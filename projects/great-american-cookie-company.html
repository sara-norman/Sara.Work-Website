            <h5>Solidifying Systems</h5>
            <p>In order to understand the pre-existing site and to make informed improvements, it was important to collaborate with our off-site development team. All of the systems and third-party integrations of our e-commerce site were solidified and mapped out to understand the impact of the new features we were incorporating.</p>

            <h5>Simplifying E-Commerce</h5>
            <p>The initial site launched with the out-of-the-box WooCommerce experience with a branded re-skin. We wanted to increase the experience of the checkout to be more user-friendly. Under the guidance of the Creative Director and Art Director, I audited the best-in-class e-commerce sites available and identified the best features that we could mimic in our checkout experience.</p>
