            <h2>
                The Georgia Museum of Agriculture, historically known as the Agrirama, wanted their site to accurately reflect their continually growing educational story. Their new platform for historic village sites, educational resources, rental spaces, and community opportunities resulted in an increase of interaction, inquiries, and reservations.

            <h5>Extending a Pre-Existing Brand</h5>
            <p>Georgia Museum of Agriculture was going to take on the stylesheet of their parent organization Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College. This included a new logo inline with ABAC’s brand guidelines, adoption of ABAC’s style, elements, and brand.</p>

            <h5>Content Audit</h5>
            <p>Since the academic museum was constantly releasing new community initiatives, educational opportunities, resources, and more to the public, they needed a product that worked for them to accurately and concisely publish their content.</p>

            <h5>Product for the Client</h5>
            <p>We needed to learn what the user (client) was working with (the content) to build an adaptive back-end with a responsive front-end. With the WYSIWYG editor in mind, different combinations of content display different layouts due to fallback rules.</p>
